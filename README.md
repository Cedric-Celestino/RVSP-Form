# Event RSVP Form

## Description

This is an RSVP form built to enhance and refine my React JS skills. The project demonstrates:

- Form handling and validation
- State management with React hooks (`useState`)
- Conditional rendering of a summary after form submission
- Basic styling with CSS

**Acknowledgment:** Inspired by the FreeCodeCamp lab exercise.
